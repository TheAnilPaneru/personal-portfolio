# Personal Portfolio Website

## Overview

This is a personal portfolio website project that I forked from [codewithsadee/vcard-personal-portfolio](https://github.com/codewithsadee/vcard-personal-portfolio). I have made several modifications to tailor the website to my personal needs and preferences. The portfolio showcases my skills, projects, and contact information in a clean and responsive design.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive and works seamlessly on all devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
- **Modern UI**: A clean and modern user interface with smooth animations and transitions.
- **Sections**:
  - **Home**: A brief introduction about myself.
  - **About**: Detailed information about my skills, experience, and education.
  - **Portfolio**: A showcase of my projects with descriptions and links.
  - **Contact**: A form to get in touch with me, along with my social media links.
- **Customization**: I have customized the original template to better reflect my personal brand and style.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS3**: For styling and animations.

- **Font Awesome**: For icons.
